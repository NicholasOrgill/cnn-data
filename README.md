# cnn-data
This holds the CSVs for all CNN training for my MSci thesis.

The Jupyter Notebook in this repository can be run by installing Jupyter lab locally on your machineâ€”installation instructions can be found here: https://jupyter.org/install

Once installed, you need to install the required dependencies to run the graphing software in the Jupyter Notebook. I would recommend using a virtual environment in Python for this, for which you can find installation instructions here: https://packaging.python.org/guides/installing-using-pip-and-virtual-environments/

Once you have your virtual environment set up, install the required dependencies from requirements.txt using the following command in your terminal:

```bash
jupyter nbextension enable --py widgetsnbextension
```

Finally, run the Jupyter Notebook server by simply typing the following command when in the repository root:

```bash
jupyter notebook
```

This will open up a new web browser window, where you can select `cnn.ipynb`.

Run each cell to see the results in 2D, 3D, and to view the images that the neural network failed to classify in specific training runs.
